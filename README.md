# DataScienceBootcamp
in this repository I have uploaded some tasks and their details are given below:
### Assingment 1:
in the assignment I did some practice of for loops for making good understanding
### Library Management System:
In this task I created a E-library where user can add books or take books for reading and when user will take book for reading the book will be shown un available to other users.
### Food Ordering System:
This is also a basic python project in this project I created online food ordering system in the program we have dictionary where avialable food items are saved with their prices when ever someone wants to buy they will add their buying food items in a cart with quantity as well and at the end he will choose what type of payment method he wants and after all this a bill will generated in which total amount of its food will be shown..
### Student Performance:
in this project we have done EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) on a small Dataset to evaluate some insights through visual like charts and graphs..
### Students Data Assignment:
In this file I have done EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on a very big Dataset it has almost 33 columns with in the begining I started through cleaning (removing useless columns,checking do it contain null value,duplicate values) and after that I did EDA on this massive and got a lot of deep insights from this data which will furthur help in machine learning...
### Canada per capita income predictor:
in the new porject I did machine learning using linear regression algorithm to predict canada per capita income.
### Grand Project:
This is the grandproject which was about credit risk first I cleaned the dataset and then I go through Exploratory Data Analysis which gives deep insights about the data that help me in doing  machine learning first I applied logistic regression and then I applied a lot of algos and at the end I used XGBoost which gives 92% accuracy and then I deployed my model after saving using streamlit.
